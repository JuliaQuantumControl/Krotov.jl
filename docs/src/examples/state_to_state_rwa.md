# Optimization of a State-to-State Transfer in a Lambda System in the RWA

This example is illustrates the use of complex-valued control fields. This is accomplished by rewriting the Hamiltonian as the sum of two independent controls (real and imaginary parts). We consider a 3-level system in a $\Lamba$ configuration.
